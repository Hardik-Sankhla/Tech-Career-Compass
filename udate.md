    description: guide.description,
    openGraph: {
      title: guide.title,
      description: guide.description,
      images: [guide.ogImage],
    },
    twitter: {
      card: 'summary_large_image',
      title: guide.title,
      description: guide.description,
      images: [guide.twitterImage],
    },
  };
}
2. Structured Data
